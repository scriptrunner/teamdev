Labels on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can apply labels to issues and pull requests to signify priority, category, or any other information you find useful.

### [About project boards](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)

Project boards on GitHub help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With project boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.

### [Tracking the progress of your work with project boards](https://help.github.com/articles/tracking-the-progress-of-your-work-with-project-boards/)

You can use task lists to create a list of items with checkboxes within pull request and issue comments or Markdown files in your repository.

Task lists render with clickable checkboxes in comments. You can select or unselect the checkboxes to mark them as complete or incomplete.

Task lists render as read-only checkboxes in Markdown files. People with write permissions in the repository can edit the file to select or unselect the checkboxes.

You can view task list summary information in issue and pull request lists, when the task list is in the initial comment.
